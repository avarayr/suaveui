# Installation

While SuaveUI is in early alpha, installation is via cloning and running a server

Requirements: Bun, Node

1. `git clone https://github.com/avarayr/suaveui`
2. `bun install`
3. `bun dev`

# Goals

1. Have a single-executable, one-click local install app that doesn't require Docker. (Highest priority)
2. Support with OpenAI API compatible local LLM backends such as Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp server, etc.
3. Seamless upgrade process when new version is available
4. Nudge Notifications by AI personas to promote interaction

# Non-goals

* No plans for a hosted version



# Technologies used

React for UI, Node.js as light backend
